# CharacterLab agent directives

Read this file before planning or implementing work in this repository.

## Architectural authority

1. `CharacterLab — Ideal Character Architecture North Star.md` defines the required character capabilities, invariants, and research posture.
2. `CHARACTER_ARCHITECTURE.md` is the sole canonical topology: boxes, edges, state ownership, and causal ordering.
3. `CharacterLab — Ideal Character Research Program Brief.md` defines the research method, proof burden, and campaign rules.
4. `docs/formal/` defines versioned executable semantics beneath those conceptual authorities. An implementation must name the seam-contract version it implements.
5. `CharacterLab — Reference Architecture Build & Research Campaign Plan.md` owns active sequence without overriding accepted formal readiness gates.
6. `docs/planning/` records active seam status, phenomena, preservation obligations, and verdict evidence.
7. Phase briefs, historical findings, and implementation plans under `reference/` are hypothesis and control sources only.

When documents conflict, resolve the conflict upward through this hierarchy. Do not silently choose whichever formula or diagram is easiest to implement.

Authority is also scoped by subject. The Research Program Brief outranks formal documents on research method, proof burden, and campaign admissibility; it does **not** override an accepted seam contract's exact mathematics, domains, quantization, ordering, or trace schema. Conversely, a formal seam contract may instantiate the North Star and Architecture Map but may not redefine their required phenomena, causal boxes, or epistemic boundaries. A genuine cross-scope conflict must be resolved by amending the higher conceptual document or the lower formal contract explicitly, never by local implementation choice.

## Active direction

CharacterLab is undergoing a ground-zero architectural refoundation.

The active implementation belongs in `src/`. It begins only after the relevant deterministic substrate and seam contracts exist. The first implementation target is the North-Star Reference Scaffold: a thin, deterministic, end-to-end causal topology whose candidate distinctions can be ablated, substituted, merged, derived, compressed, or retracted.

Campaign 0 passed on 2026-09-01. Its immutable candidate-era identifiers remain accepted contracts. Campaign 1 is active. Exact bounded measurement under `observation/0.1-candidate` passed its vectors and closed `MATH-006`, but its concept-token path is only a restricted identity-establishing-channel control. `SEM-001` is the current P0 blocker: do not allocate semantic-binding record IDs or implement general event bindings, perceptual referents, perceptual classifications, recognition hypotheses, or downstream encoding/learning until `semantic-binding/0.1-candidate`, `PHEN-SEM-001`, and the `CV-SEM-*` gate resolve. Visibility never implies recognition; classification, tracking, recognition, and appraisal are separate; truth-source handles and unobserved truth facets remain trace-side. `ONT-001` owns the later full ontology/inheritance/affordance system, while `SEM-001` may use only its explicitly governed finite fixture vocabulary.

Do not automatically resume the former Phase 3A → 3B → 3C plan.

## Historical implementation boundary

The complete pre-refoundation implementation is preserved under `reference/src/`.

- Treat `reference/` as read-only historical evidence and a source of control implementations.
- Do not import any module from `reference/` into `src/`.
- Do not copy a historical mechanism into `src/` merely because it already exists.
- Reuse requires an explicit architectural reason and must preserve the new seam contract rather than the historical module shape.
- Do not modify `reference/` unless the task explicitly concerns historical reproducibility or a reference-only correction.
- Run `npm run test:reference` when validating the preserved implementation.

Git history and `reference/` preserve the past. New work must not make the historical tree canonical by accident.

## Fresh-source rules

- `npm test` targets only tests under the new `src/` tree.
- No character-model primitive is authoritative merely because it existed before refoundation.
- Keep truth, evidence, memory, recognition, belief, appraisal, affect, motivation, reasons, decision, intent, expression, execution, and consolidation separately traceable until experiments earn a reduction.
- Prefer explicit competing implementations over compatibility flags threaded through the historical model.
- Record reduction verdicts with their tested phenomenon corpus.
- Treat `../vivarium/Docs/CharacterLabMathematicalReference.md` as a formula inventory, not authority. Import only through the formula-intake ledger and a versioned formal seam contract.
- Preserve the Phase 2.9–2.97 unresolved-Decision dice grammar and reinforcing identity loop as mandatory initial reference implementations and controls. Port them through new seam contracts; do not omit, replace with opaque weighted randomness, or discard their regression experiments without an explicit reduction experiment and verdict.
- Before designing or implementing any seam, consult `docs/planning/REFERENCE_MECHANISM_LEDGER.md`. Every applicable historical mechanism or finding must receive an explicit port, control, corpus, candidate, supersession, or retirement decision. Do not silently drop it merely because active source started clean.
