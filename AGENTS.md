# CharacterLab agent directives

Read this file before planning or implementing work in this repository.

## Architectural authority

1. `CharacterLab — Ideal Character Architecture North Star.md` defines the required character capabilities, invariants, and research posture.
2. `CHARACTER_ARCHITECTURE.md` is the sole canonical topology: boxes, edges, state ownership, and causal ordering.
3. `CharacterLab — Ideal Character Research Program Brief.md` defines the research method, proof burden, and campaign rules.
4. `docs/formal/` defines versioned executable semantics beneath those conceptual authorities. An implementation must name the seam-contract version it implements.
5. `docs/planning/` records active seam status, phenomena, and verdict evidence.
6. Phase briefs, historical findings, and implementation plans under `reference/` are hypothesis and control sources only.

When documents conflict, resolve the conflict upward through this hierarchy. Do not silently choose whichever formula or diagram is easiest to implement.

## Active direction

CharacterLab is undergoing a ground-zero architectural refoundation.

The active implementation belongs in `src/`. It begins only after the relevant deterministic substrate and seam contracts exist. The first implementation target is the North-Star Reference Scaffold: a thin, deterministic, end-to-end causal topology whose candidate distinctions can be ablated, substituted, merged, derived, compressed, or retracted.

Do not automatically resume the former Phase 3A → 3B → 3C plan.

## Historical implementation boundary

The complete pre-refoundation implementation is preserved under `reference/src/`.

- Treat `reference/` as read-only historical evidence and a source of control implementations.
- Do not import any module from `reference/` into `src/`.
- Do not copy a historical mechanism into `src/` merely because it already exists.
- Reuse requires an explicit architectural reason and must preserve the new seam contract rather than the historical module shape.
- Do not modify `reference/` unless the task explicitly concerns historical reproducibility or a reference-only correction.
- Run `npm run test:reference` when validating the preserved implementation.

Git history and `reference/` preserve the past. New work must not make the historical tree canonical by accident.

## Fresh-source rules

- `npm test` targets only tests under the new `src/` tree.
- No character-model primitive is authoritative merely because it existed before refoundation.
- Keep truth, evidence, memory, recognition, belief, appraisal, affect, motivation, reasons, decision, intent, expression, execution, and consolidation separately traceable until experiments earn a reduction.
- Prefer explicit competing implementations over compatibility flags threaded through the historical model.
- Record reduction verdicts with their tested phenomenon corpus.
- Treat `../vivarium/Docs/CharacterLabMathematicalReference.md` as a formula inventory, not authority. Import only through the formula-intake ledger and a versioned formal seam contract.
- Preserve the Phase 2.9–2.97 unresolved-Decision dice grammar and reinforcing identity loop as mandatory initial reference implementations and controls. Port them through new seam contracts; do not omit, replace with opaque weighted randomness, or discard their regression experiments without an explicit reduction experiment and verdict.
- Before designing or implementing any seam, consult `docs/planning/REFERENCE_MECHANISM_LEDGER.md`. Every applicable historical mechanism or finding must receive an explicit port, control, corpus, candidate, supersession, or retirement decision. Do not silently drop it merely because active source started clean.
